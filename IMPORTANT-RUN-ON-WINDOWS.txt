IMPORTANT: WSL/Windows Localhost Issue
=====================================

The application cannot be accessed from Windows browser when running in WSL due to networking limitations.

SOLUTION: Run the application directly on Windows (not in WSL)
=============================================================

1. Open Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell (NOT WSL)
   - Press Windows Key + R
   - Type "cmd" or "powershell" and press Enter

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd "C:\Users\Rolando Fender\medpay-pro"

3. Run the installation script:
   install-dependencies.bat

4. Start the application:
   start-windows.bat

The application will then be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your Windows browser.

ALTERNATIVE: Deploy to Vercel
=============================
Since you mentioned the app will be hosted on Vercel, you can:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel (https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
5. Deploy automatically

Your app will then be accessible at your Vercel URL without any localhost issues.
